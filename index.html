Taking a career cluster survey can reveal patterns in your interests and strengths that point toward promising career fields. Many educational institutions now offer the career clusters interest survey in PDF format for easy access and distribution to students. Comprehensive career clusters surveys typically categorize occupations into distinct groups based on similar workplace characteristics and skill requirements. Finding a career clusters survey in PDF allows counselors and teachers to distribute materials to large groups without requiring internet access during the assessment process.
The widely recognized 16 career clusters survey provides a framework developed by the U.S. Department of Education to categorize all occupations. Downloading a career cluster interest survey in PDF gives you the flexibility to complete the assessment at your own pace without time constraints. The career interest cluster survey results can highlight promising fields you might never have previously considered.
